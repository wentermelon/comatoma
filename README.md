[BC Game Jam](https://bcgamejam.com/) 2020 submission with Team ComaToma.

The themes for this year were: "Prevail", "Compassion", and "Pack".

## Summary
*ComaToma* is a visual novel about a sleep deprived boy named Toma who struggles with anxiety. One day, his mom gives him something to help him sleep which causes Toma to fall into a very deep slumber where he begins a journey into his mind to face his inner fears and emotions. As Toma explores his dreamscape, he will meet an unlikely *pack* of friends and you, as the player, will guide Toma to make decisions to exercise *compassion* or indifference. The question is, can Toma *prevail* over his inner demons or will he succumb to them?

The game was built on the RenPy Visual Novel Engine. Run the comatoma.exe to play!

## About the Team
First "game jam" or hackathon event for most of the team but we're proud to create a simple game, start to end, from scratch.
Even though the game is only a few minutes long, it took a lot of work to plan the script, create the art, and put it all together using RenPy.
